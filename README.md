# MutNet
A heterogeneous network embedding based method by integrating genomic data with genesâ€™ biological processes including protein-protein interactions and pathways.
## Installation
1. Run the following commands for installation:
```
wget https://github.com/AMSSwanglab/MutNet/archive/master.zip  
unzip master.zip
cd MutNet-master
```  
2. Prepare necessary datasets for MutNet including:

Pathway from Reactome:
```
cd ./pathways
wget https://reactome.org/download/current/ReactomePathways.gmt.zip
unzip ReactomePathways.gmt.zip
wget https://reactome.org/download/current/ReactomePathwaysRelation.txt
```
PPI from STRING (and preprocess):
```
cd ./PPI
wget https://stringdb-downloads.org/download/protein.links.v11.5.txt.gz
gunzip protein.links.v11.5.txt.gz
python prePPI.py
```

## Run MutNet
1. Prepare input file in the `./data`: MutNet takes a `.csv` file as input, with which each line shoud have at least 4 columns: `Gene`, `Tumor_Sample`, `Tumor_Type`, `Variant_Classification`. A sample input data can be download from http://karchinlab.org/data/Protocol/pancan-mutation-set-from-Tokheim-2016.txt.gz.
2. Edit `args_profile.txt`, crucial information including:
*  `Mutation_file` for path of input file; 
*  `Pathway_Dir` for path to pathways datasets;
*  `Result_Path` for path to PPI dataset; 
*  `PPI_file` for input file name.
3. After preparing the input files as above, run the following command:
```
python getembed.py
python ConstructNet.py
python outdrivers.py
```
Consturction of network for propagation can be time-consuming. Constructed networks for pan-cancer datasets can be accessed with the following command:
```
cd ./Result/PanCancer/
unrar ./Network_pathwayn.rar
unrar ./Network_ppi.rar
```
and then `python ConstructNet.py` can be skipped.

4. A fold will be constructed in the `Result_Path` fold according to the args, and predicted cancer gene will be listed in `driver_genes.csv` in the fold.

A list for all genes with MutScore_raw and MutScore_AfterNP is also provided in `gene_info_proped.csv`
